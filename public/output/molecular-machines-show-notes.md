# Molecular Machines: Engineering at the Nanoscale
**Publication Date:** March 28, 2025


## Episode Overview
In this episode of Frontiers of Research, Antoni, Sarah, and Josh explore the fascinating world of molecular machines - devices designed and built at the molecular level that can perform controlled mechanical movements. The conversation covers the fundamental principles of molecular machine design, recent breakthroughs in light-powered motors, visualization techniques, applications across multiple fields, and the challenges of scaling up to more complex systems.

## Key Points Discussed

### Fundamentals of Molecular Machines

### Design Principles and Challenges
- Random thermal motion at the molecular scale versus inertia and gravity at the macroscopic scale
- Energy landscapes with stable states and controllable barriers
- External stimuli for triggering movement (light, pH, electrical signals)
- Mechanically interlocked molecules that can't separate

### Light-Powered Molecular Motors
- Feringa's motors based on carbon-carbon double bonds
- Photochemical isomerization followed by thermal relaxation
