   - Precise changes without donor DNA templates
   - Applications for point mutation diseases

2. **RNA Targeting CRISPR Systems**
   - Advantages of transient RNA editing
   - Cas13 as an RNA-targeting CRISPR enzyme
   - REPAIR system combining CRISPR with ADAR enzymes
   - Cas7-11 for improved RNA editing efficiency
   - Hybrid systems combining targeting and enzymatic functions

3. **Chemical Delivery Technologies**
   - Lipid nanoparticles for CRISPR component delivery
   - Cell-penetrating peptide conjugation approaches
   - Functionalized gold nanoparticles for tissue targeting
   - Size-minimized Cas enzymes for viral vector compatibility
   - Blood-brain barrier crossing strategies

4. **Specificity Enhancement**
   - High-fidelity Cas9 variants through protein engineering
   - Chemically modified guide RNAs for improved specificity
   - Anti-CRISPR proteins and small molecule inhibitors
   - Base editors for direct nucleotide conversion
   - Multi-step recognition requirements in newer systems

5. **Temporally Controlled Editing**
   - Light-activated (optogenetic) CRISPR systems
   - Small-molecule regulated Cas9 variants
   - Temperature-sensitive editing systems
   - Chemically induced proximity approaches
   - Combined spatial and temporal control

## Notable Quotes
> "Prime editing can make precise changes - substitutions, insertions, or deletions - without cutting both DNA strands and without requiring a donor DNA template. This has huge implications for correcting the vast majority of human genetic diseases, which are caused by simple point mutations." - Sarah

> "The field has moved from harnessing natural systems to designing completely synthetic ones optimized for specific applications - I think this trend of chemically engineered precision will continue to accelerate." - Josh
