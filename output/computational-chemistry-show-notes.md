## Glossary

**Ab initio methods**: Computational approaches based on quantum mechanics without empirical parameters.

**Density Functional Theory (DFT)**: A computational quantum mechanical modeling method that investigates the electronic structure of many-body systems by using functionals of the electron density.

**Molecular dynamics**: Computer simulation method that analyzes the physical movements of atoms and molecules over time.

**Force field**: A set of parameters and mathematical functions used to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms or coarse-grained particles in molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations.

**QM/MM**: Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics, a hybrid approach that treats part of a system with quantum mechanics and the rest with molecular mechanics.

**CCSD(T)**: Coupled Cluster with Single, Double, and perturbative Triple excitations, often called the "gold standard" of quantum chemistry.

**Virtual screening**: Computational technique used to search libraries of small molecules to identify those structures which are most likely to bind to a drug target.

**Machine learning potential**: A potential energy function trained on quantum mechanical data that can predict energies and forces at reduced computational cost.
