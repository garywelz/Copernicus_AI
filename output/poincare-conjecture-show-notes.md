# The Poincaré Conjecture: A Century-Long Mathematical Journey
**Publication Date:** March 28, 2025


## Episode Summary
A deep dive into one of mathematics' most famous problems, from Henri Poincaré's initial conjecture in 1904 through its eventual solution by Grigori Perelman in 2002. We explore the deep connections between topology, geometry, and analysis that led to its resolution.

   - Spherical geometry (positive curvature)
   - Hyperbolic geometry (negative curvature)
   - Euclidean geometry (flat)
   - S² × R (cylinder-like)
   - H² × R (hyperbolic space with a line)
   - Nil geometry (Heisenberg group)
   - Sol geometry
   - SL(2,R) geometry

   - Perelman's surgical technique
   - Entropy concepts

## Notable Quotes
> "What's fascinating is that Poincaré actually first proposed a false conjecture, found a counterexample himself, and then refined it into what we now know as the Poincaré Conjecture." - Dr. Rachel

> "Perelman's breakthrough came through a deep understanding of these singularities." - Dr. Rachel
