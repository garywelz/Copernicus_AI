## Glossary

**Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: A secure communication method that uses quantum mechanics principles to establish a shared secret key between distant parties.

**BB84 Protocol**: The first quantum cryptography protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, using quantum states to securely distribute cryptographic keys.

**No-cloning theorem**: A principle of quantum mechanics that forbids the creation of an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.

**Shor's algorithm**: A quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms, threatening RSA and other public-key cryptosystems.

**Post-quantum cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against attacks from quantum computers.

**Lattice-based cryptography**: Cryptographic systems based on the hardness of certain problems involving geometric objects called lattices.

**CRYSTALS-Kyber**: A lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism selected by NIST for standardization as a post-quantum algorithm.

**Quantum repeater**: A device that extends the range of quantum communication by preserving quantum states over long distances.

**Side-channel attack**: An attack based on information gained from the physical implementation of a cryptosystem, rather than theoretical weaknesses.

**Crypto agility**: The ability of security systems to quickly switch between different cryptographic primitives without significant system changes.
