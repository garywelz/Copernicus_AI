# Physics News - Episode 1

**Publication Date: March 28, 2025

In this premiere episode of Physics News, host Alex and a team of expert correspondents bring you the latest breakthroughs in theoretical and experimental physics. The episode covers four major developments: CERN's latest results from the Large Hadron Collider that challenge aspects of the Standard Model, the first direct observation of gravitational waves from a neutron star-black hole merger, a breakthrough in room-temperature superconductivity, and the development of a new quantum sensor capable of detecting dark matter candidates.

Join correspondents Nikolai, James, Mei, and Sophia as they delve into the scientific details and implications of these discoveries. From potential cracks in the Standard Model to revolutionary quantum sensing technology, this episode provides rigorous coverage of cutting-edge physics research that matters to professionals, researchers, and educators in the field.

Physics News delivers concise, in-depth analysis of significant developments across all areas of physics, keeping you informed about the latest advances that could impact your research and teaching.
