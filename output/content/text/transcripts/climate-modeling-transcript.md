**Amara** Welcome to EarthScience Today, the podcast where we explore the latest developments in understanding our planet. I'm Amara, your host and atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of climate modeling—the computational tools that help us understand Earth's climate system and project its future. Joining me are Miguel, a climate physicist who develops global climate models, and Leila, an environmental data scientist who specializes in model validation and uncertainty analysis.

**Miguel** Thanks for having us, Amara. Climate modeling has evolved tremendously over the past few decades, and it's exciting to discuss how these tools are helping us understand our changing planet.

**Leila** Absolutely. And it's important to talk about both the capabilities and limitations of these models, especially given their critical role in informing climate policy.

**Amara** Let's start with the basics. Miguel, what exactly is a climate model, and how does it differ from a weather forecast model?

**Miguel** At its core, a climate model is a mathematical representation of the Earth's climate system, built using fundamental physical equations that govern the behavior of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. These models divide the Earth into a three-dimensional grid and solve these equations for each grid cell, tracking how energy and matter move through the system over time.

The key difference between climate and weather models lies in their purpose and time scale. Weather forecast models aim to predict specific conditions—like temperature, precipitation, and wind—at particular locations over short time periods, typically days to weeks. They focus on the initial state of the atmosphere and how it evolves.

Climate models, on the other hand, aren't trying to predict the weather on a specific day years from now. Instead, they're designed to capture the statistical patterns of weather—what we call climate—over longer periods, typically decades to centuries. They focus less on initial conditions and more on boundary conditions like greenhouse gas concentrations, solar output, and land use changes.

It's the difference between predicting whether it will rain next Tuesday in Chicago versus projecting how rainfall patterns in the Midwest might change over the next 50 years as the planet warms.

**Amara** That's a helpful distinction. Could you walk us through how climate models have evolved over time? What capabilities do today's models have that earlier versions didn't?

**Miguel**: Climate modeling has come a long way since the first models were developed in the 1960s and 70s. Early models were extremely simplified, often representing just the atmosphere with very coarse resolution—grid cells might be hundreds of kilometers across—and they included only basic physical processes.

Today's models, often called Earth System Models, are far more comprehensive. They typically include detailed representations of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and sea ice, along with biogeochemical cycles like the carbon cycle. Modern models have much finer resolution, with grid cells often tens of kilometers across, allowing them to better represent features like mountain ranges and ocean currents.

They also incorporate many more processes: cloud formation, aerosol interactions, vegetation dynamics, ocean biogeochemistry, ice sheet dynamics, and human activities like agriculture and urbanization. Some models are even beginning to incorporate social and economic systems to better represent human responses to climate change.

Computing power has been a major driver of this evolution. Today's supercomputers allow us to run simulations that would have been impossible just a decade ago, enabling higher resolution and more complex physics.

**Leila**: If I could add to that, another important development has been the growth of ensemble modeling. Rather than running a single simulation, we now typically run multiple simulations with slightly different initial conditions or model parameters. This ensemble approach helps us better understand the range of possible outcomes and quantify uncertainty.

We've also seen major advances in how we incorporate observations into models, both for initialization and validation. Satellite data, in particular, has revolutionized our ability to observe the Earth system globally and continuously, providing crucial constraints for our models.

**Amara**: Leila, you mentioned uncertainty. Could you elaborate on how scientists evaluate climate models and understand their limitations?

**Leila**: Absolutely. Evaluating climate models is a complex but essential process. We use several approaches to test how well models represent the real climate system.

One key method is hindcasting—running models for historical periods and comparing their output to observed data. If a model can accurately reproduce past climate changes, like the warming trend of the 20th century or the cooling after major volcanic eruptions, it gives us more confidence in its projections of future change.

We also evaluate specific processes within models. For example, how well does a model simulate the El Niño-Southern Oscillation or monsoon patterns? This process-based evaluation helps identify specific strengths and weaknesses.

Regarding limitations, all models are simplifications of reality and have inherent uncertainties. These come from several sources. First, there's structural uncertainty—different models represent physical processes in different ways, leading to different projections even with the same inputs.

Then there's parametric uncertainty. Many small-scale processes, like cloud formation, can't be directly simulated at the model's resolution, so they're represented using parameterizations—simplified equations with adjustable parameters. Different parameter choices can lead to different outcomes.

There's also scenario uncertainty—we don't know exactly how greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and other human factors will evolve in the future, so we run models with different scenarios to explore possible outcomes.

And finally, there's internal variability—the natural fluctuations in the climate system that occur even without external forcing. This natural "noise" can mask or amplify the "signal" of climate change, especially at regional scales and over shorter time periods.

**Miguel**: I'd add that models also face computational constraints. Even with today's supercomputers, we still have to make trade-offs between resolution, complexity, and simulation length. Higher resolution allows better representation of important features like storms and ocean eddies but requires more computing power, which might mean simpler physics or shorter simulations.

**Amara**: Those are important considerations. Let's talk about what climate models have taught us. What are some of the key insights we've gained from climate modeling over the years?

**Miguel**: Climate models have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Earth system in numerous ways. Perhaps most significantly, they've helped establish the link between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Early models in the 1970s and 80s predicted that increasing CO₂ would lead to warming, and subsequent observations have confirmed these projections.

Models have also helped us understand climate sensitivity—how much warming we can expect from a given increase in greenhouse gases. While there's still uncertainty in the exact value, models consistently show that doubling atmospheric CO₂ will likely lead to between 2 and 4.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

Another crucial insight has been the role of various feedback mechanisms in the climate system. For example, models have shown how water vapor feedback amplifies warming, how changes in snow and ice cover can accelerate Arctic warming, and how the carbon cycle might respond to warming by releasing more CO₂ and methane from soils and permafrost.

Models have also been essential for attributing observed climate changes to specific causes. Through attribution studies, we can determine how much of the observed warming is due to human activities versus natural factors like solar variations or volcanic eruptions. These studies consistently show that observed warming since the mid-20th century is primarily due to human influences.

**Leila**: Building on that, models have also provided valuable insights into regional climate changes. While global average temperature is important, what people experience is local weather and climate. Models help us understand how global warming translates to regional changes in precipitation, extreme events, sea level rise, and other impacts that directly affect communities.

For instance, models have helped explain why the Arctic is warming much faster than the global average—a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification—and why land areas are warming faster than oceans. They've also helped us understand complex phenomena like changes in monsoon patterns, shifts in storm tracks, and the intensification of the hydrological cycle, where wet regions tend to get wetter and dry regions drier.

Another important contribution has been in understanding climate tipping points—thresholds beyond which parts of the Earth system could undergo rapid, potentially irreversible changes. Models have helped identify potential tipping elements like the Amazon rainforest, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and the conditions that might trigger them.

[MUSIC: Transition]

**Amara**: Let's talk about how climate models are used in practice. How do these tools inform climate policy and decision-making?

**Miguel**: Climate models serve as essential tools for informing policy in several ways. Most visibly, they provide projections of future climate change under different emission scenarios, which helps policymakers understand the potential consequences of different policy choices. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, which synthesize climate science to inform international climate negotiations, rely heavily on model projections.

These projections help answer questions like: How much warming can we expect if emissions continue on their current trajectory? How quickly do emissions need to decrease to limit warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius? What climate impacts can we expect under different warming scenarios?

Models also help evaluate specific policy options. For example, they can assess the climate benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, implementing carbon capture technologies, or changing land use practices. They can also evaluate proposed geoengineering approaches, like solar radiation management, and their potential side effects.

Increasingly, climate models are being used in conjunction with impact models to assess risks to agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. This integrated assessment approach helps policymakers understand not just how the climate will change, but what those changes mean for society and ecosystems.

**Leila**: It's worth noting that the way models inform policy has evolved. Rather than simply providing deterministic predictions, the field has moved toward a risk management framework that acknowledges uncertainties. This approach recognizes that while we can't predict the future climate with absolute certainty, we can quantify risks and make informed decisions under uncertainty.

This is similar to how we approach other areas with uncertainty, like financial planning or public health. You don't need to know exactly when a pandemic will occur to invest in preparedness, and you don't need to know exactly how much the climate will warm to recognize that reducing emissions reduces risks.

Models are also increasingly being used at regional and local scales to inform adaptation planning. Communities need to understand how climate change might affect them specifically—will they face more flooding, drought, heat waves, or sea level rise?—to develop appropriate adaptation strategies. Downscaling techniques allow us to translate global model projections to more locally relevant information, though this adds additional layers of uncertainty.

**Amara**: You've both mentioned uncertainty several times. How do scientists communicate uncertainty in climate projections while still providing actionable information?

**Leila**: That's a crucial question. Communicating uncertainty effectively is one of the biggest challenges in climate science. On one hand, we need to be honest about the limitations of our knowledge and the range of possible outcomes. On the other hand, uncertainty shouldn't be used as an excuse for inaction when the broad direction of change is clear.

One approach is to clearly distinguish between what we know with high confidence and what remains more uncertain. For example, we have high confidence that the Earth will continue to warm with increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and that this warming will lead to sea level rise, more intense heat waves, and changes in precipitation patterns. The exact magnitude and timing of these changes at regional scales is less certain.

Another approach is to present results probabilistically. Rather than saying "temperature will increase by X degrees," we might say "there's a 66% probability that warming will be between X and Y degrees." This better reflects our state of knowledge and helps decision-makers understand the range of possibilities they need to prepare for.

We also use scenario-based approaches, presenting projections under different possible futures—from high-emission scenarios where fossil fuel use continues to grow, to low-emission scenarios with rapid decarbonization. This helps illustrate how different choices lead to different outcomes, without having to predict which path society will take.

**Miguel**: I'd add that it's important to put climate uncertainties in context. All complex decisions involve uncertainty—whether in business, medicine, or personal life—yet we still make plans and take action. Climate uncertainty doesn't mean we know nothing; it means we have a range of possible outcomes to consider.

It's also worth noting that uncertainty cuts both ways. While climate impacts might be less severe than our central projections, they could also be more severe. Some of the most concerning potential impacts, like rapid ice sheet collapse or ecosystem tipping points, are among the most uncertain aspects of future projections.

**Amara**: Looking to the future, how do you see climate modeling evolving in the coming years? What advances are on the horizon?

**Miguel**: We're at an exciting juncture in climate modeling. Several trends are likely to shape the field in the coming years.

First, we'll continue to see increases in resolution as computing power grows. Some models are now approaching resolutions fine enough to explicitly represent important processes like thunderstorms and ocean eddies, rather than parameterizing them. This "convection-permitting" modeling should improve representations of extreme precipitation, tropical cyclones, and other high-impact events.

We're also seeing advances in machine learning applications for climate modeling. AI techniques can help improve parameterizations, enhance computational efficiency, identify patterns in climate data, and bridge the gap between global models and local impacts. These methods won't replace physics-based models but will complement them in powerful ways.

Another frontier is more comprehensive Earth system modeling. Future models will better represent interactions between the physical climate, biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets, and human systems. This includes more sophisticated representations of land use, agriculture, urban areas, and energy systems, allowing for more integrated analysis of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.

**Leila**: I'm particularly excited about advances in how we integrate observations with models. Data assimilation techniques, similar to those used in weather forecasting, are being adapted for climate applications to better constrain models with observational data. This should help reduce biases and narrow uncertainty ranges.

We're also seeing progress in quantifying and constraining uncertainty. New statistical techniques and larger ensemble simulations are helping us better understand the range of possible climate futures and assign probabilities to different outcomes.

Another important development is the democratization of climate modeling. More accessible computing resources and simplified model interfaces are allowing a broader community of researchers, including those from developing countries, to contribute to model development and analysis. This diversity of perspectives is crucial for addressing the global challenge of climate change.

Finally, there's growing emphasis on making climate information more usable for decision-makers. This includes developing climate services that translate model outputs into actionable information for specific sectors like agriculture, water management, energy, and disaster risk reduction.

**Amara**: Those are fascinating developments. As we wrap up, I'd like to ask each of you: What do you think is the most important thing for the public to understand about climate models and their role in addressing climate change?

**Miguel**: I think it's crucial for people to understand that while climate models aren't perfect, they're based on well-established physical principles and have successfully predicted many aspects of climate change before they were observed. The warming trend, Arctic amplification, stratospheric cooling, and intensification of the hydrological cycle were all projected by models before being confirmed by observations.

Models shouldn't be seen as crystal balls that predict the exact future, but rather as tools that help us understand how the climate system works and explore the consequences of different choices we might make. They're one line of evidence among many—including observations of current and past climate changes, laboratory experiments, and theoretical understanding—that together build our knowledge of climate change.

Despite their limitations, models remain our best tool for looking ahead and informing the decisions we need to make today to shape our climate future. The fact that there are uncertainties in climate projections doesn't mean we should wait for perfect knowledge before acting—it means we need to make decisions that are robust across a range of possible futures.

**Leila**: I'd emphasize that climate models are constantly being tested, improved, and refined based on new observations and scientific understanding. The climate modeling community is highly self-critical, always looking for ways to reduce biases and improve representations of key processes. This ongoing refinement means our confidence in model projections has grown over time, even as we continue to acknowledge their limitations.

I also think it's important for people to understand that uncertainty in climate projections stems largely from uncertainty about human choices—how quickly we'll reduce emissions, change land use practices, and develop new technologies—rather than from fundamental uncertainty about how the climate system responds to these factors. In other words, the biggest unknown in climate projections is us.

Finally, I'd want people to know that climate models aren't just academic tools—they're increasingly being used to address practical questions that affect communities around the world. How high should we build coastal defenses? How might agricultural zones shift? Which communities are most vulnerable to heat stress? Models help us anticipate these changes and plan accordingly, potentially saving lives and resources.

**Amara**: Thank you both for those thoughtful perspectives. Today we've explored the science of climate modeling—how these computational tools work, what they've taught us about Earth's climate system, how they inform policy decisions, and where the field is headed. What's clear is that while climate models have limitations and uncertainties, they remain essential tools for understanding our changing planet and navigating the challenges ahead.

As we face the complex challenge of climate change, models provide valuable guidance—not by predicting the future with certainty, but by helping us understand the consequences of our choices and the range of possible futures we might create. By combining model projections with other lines of evidence and applying a risk management approach, we can make informed decisions despite uncertainty.
