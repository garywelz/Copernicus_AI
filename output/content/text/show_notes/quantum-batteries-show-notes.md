## Notable Quotes
> "The crucial breakthrough demonstrated in labs in 2022 and 2023 is that charging speed can scale with the square of the number of quantum units. So doubling the size of your quantum battery doesn't just double the charging speed - it quadruples it!" - Rachel

> "Quantum batteries represent a rare case where quantum effects, which we typically observe only at the microscopic level, could potentially have macroscopic, real-world applications in energy technology." - Josh
