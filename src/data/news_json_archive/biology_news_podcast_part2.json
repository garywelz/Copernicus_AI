These include parts of the Red Sea, certain atolls in the central Pacific, sections of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and surprisingly, some reefs in the Caribbean that were previously thought to be highly vulnerable."

      "text": "These resilient reefs share several key characteristics. First, they tend to have high genetic diversity within coral populations, providing more raw material for natural selection. Second, they're often located in areas with strong water circulation patterns that help dissipate heat during extreme events. Third, many are in regions with moderate turbidity or upwelling, which can reduce light stress during high temperature events."
