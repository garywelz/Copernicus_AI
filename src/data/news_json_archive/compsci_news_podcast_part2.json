      "text": "This quantum correlated randomness serves as the foundation for a novel approach to secure computation that combines elements of quantum teleportation, blind quantum computing, and classical secret sharing. The protocol allows parties to jointly evaluate arbitrary quantum circuits on their private inputs without revealing those inputs or intermediate results."

First, it provides information-theoretic security\u2014meaning its security guarantees don't depend on computational hardness assumptions but are instead backed by the fundamental laws of physics. Second, it can efficiently support a much broader range of computations, including quantum algorithms that offer exponential speedups for certain problems. And third, it achieves dramatically lower communication complexity for many important functions."
