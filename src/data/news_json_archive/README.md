# News Podcast JSON Archive

This directory contains JSON files used for generating news podcast episodes across different scientific disciplines. These files serve as the source data for the podcast generation scripts.

## File Structure

Each podcast episode consists of two parts, with corresponding JSON files:

- `{subject}_news_podcast.json` - Contains the first part of the podcast episode
- `{subject}_news_podcast_part2.json` - Contains the second part of the podcast episode

Where `{subject}` is one of:
- `biology`
- `chemistry`
- `compsci`
- `math`
- `physics`
- `science`

## JSON Format

Each JSON file follows this structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Subject News - Episode X",
  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": {
        "name": "Speaker Name",
        "voice_id": "ElevenLabs Voice ID"
      },
      "text": "The spoken content for this segment"
    },
    // Additional segments...
  ]
}
```

## Usage

These JSON files are used by the podcast generation scripts located in `/src/scripts/`:

### Using Consolidated Scripts (Recommended)

We now have consolidated scripts that can handle multiple subjects:

1. **Create JSON files**: 
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/create_news_podcast.py [subject]
   ```
   Where `[subject]` is one of the subjects listed above, or `all` to process all subjects.

2. **Generate audio from JSON**:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/generate_news_podcast.py [subject]
   ```

3. **Process everything in one step**:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/process_news_podcast.py [subject]
   ```
   This script handles both creation and generation in one step.

### Using Legacy Scripts

The original individual scripts have been moved to the `src/scripts/legacy_news_scripts/` directory. These scripts are deprecated in favor of the consolidated scripts above.

If you need to use the legacy scripts for any reason, you can find them in that directory:

```bash
python src/scripts/legacy_news_scripts/create_math_news_podcast.py
```

## Maintenance

When updating podcast content:
1. Edit the corresponding creation script for the specific subject
2. Run the creation script to generate updated JSON files
3. Run the generation script to create new audio files based on the updated JSON

Do not edit these JSON files directly unless necessary, as they are meant to be generated by the creation scripts.
